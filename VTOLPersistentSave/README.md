# VTOL VR Persistent Saving

Ever got sad that you lost your progress in VTOL VR because you had to leave the game? Well, this mod is for you!

With the mod, after every game startup, first time you open up the quicksave MFD page, it will load up the last quicksave you made on that play session.

Do try to keep it sane and only quickload into the same mission you were playing before, as the game might not like it if you try to quickload into a different mission/map.

Feel free to post any issues or suggestions for future development on this!
