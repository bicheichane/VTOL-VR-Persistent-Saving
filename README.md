# VTOL VR Persistent Saving

Ever got sad that you lost your progress in VTOL VR because you had to leave the game? Well, this mod is for you!

With this mod, after you've made any quicksave, the first time you open the quicksave MFD page after every game startup you will have the Load button visible, and until you quicksave again, quickloading will take you to the previous session's quicksave.

Do try to keep it sane and only quickload into the same mission you were playing before, as the game might not like it if you try to quickload into a different mission/map.
